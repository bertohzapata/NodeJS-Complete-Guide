## NodeJS

NodeJS is a JavaScript Runtime. It meansyou can run JavaScript with superpowers outside de browser.
NodeJs uses Google's V8 engine inside. It takes JavaScript code and compiles it to machine code and this code runs in your computer.

V8 itself is writter in C++ and NodeJS takes that v8 codebase and adds certain features like for example:
- working with your local file system
- opening, reading, writting and deleting files
- work with your Operating System

With NodeJS you can run javascript scripts on your computer which then suddenly can access these new features because they don't run in the browser.
